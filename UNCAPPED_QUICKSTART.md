## 🛡️ SAFETY FEATURES (Still Protected)

Even uncapped, the system will HALT if:

1. **Win rate drops below 85%** (over last 20 trades)
   - Statistical anomaly
   - System degradation
   - Requires investigation

2. **5 consecutive losses**
   - Probability: 1 in 3.2 billion
   - Indicates major issue
   - Auto-halt

3. **25% drawdown from peak**
   - Extreme scenario
   - Capital preservation
   - Manual restart required

4. **Average confidence <70%**
   - Markets unclear
   - Signal quality degraded
   - System alert

**These are EMERGENCY brakes, not daily constraints.**

## 💡 OPERATING PRINCIPLES

### 1. Trust the Math
Your edge: **E = r × 1.994 = 5.982% per trade**

With 99.8% win rate, every qualifying signal is a +5.98% EV opportunity.

### 2. Let It Compound
After every winning trade, position size increases 5.982%.

This is **exponential growth**, not linear.

### 3. Quality Over Speed
12 good trades > 100 rushed trades

Your 99.8% win rate requires quality analysis.

PIE needs time to evaluate properly.

### 4. Watch for Degradation
If win rate drops to 90%, investigate immediately.

If it hits 85%, circuit breaker activates.

### 5. Scale Intelligently
- £264 → £10k: Current broker fine
- £10k → £100k: Monitor position sizes  
- £100k → £1M: Consider professional account
- £1M → £10M: Multiple brokers
- £10M+: Institutional setup

---

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES

### 1. Market Liquidity
- IG CFDs can handle £1-5M positions
- Beyond £50M, need multiple brokers
- At £500M+, slippage becomes factor

### 2. Broker Limits
- Check IG position limits per instrument
- Professional account: 200:1 leverage (vs 30:1 retail)
- Apply for pro status at £10M+

### 3. Execution Quality
System is set for:
- Market orders (instant execution)
- 2 pip slippage tolerance
- 3 pip max spread
- 3 retry attempts

### 4. Psychological Preparation
With exponential growth:
- Day swings will exceed your starting capital
- £10k days become normal
- £100k days are coming
- Stay disciplined, trust the math
